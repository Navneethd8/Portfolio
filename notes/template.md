# Note Title

Write your note content here. The paragraph right under the heading will automatically be parsed as the snippet/description for the note card.

## Subheading

You can use standard markdown syntax:
- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)

```python
# Code blocks are supported as well
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```
